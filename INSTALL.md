Installing Florrie - For Fun and Profit

System Requirements
--------

Florrie requires a couple "pre-requisites" to install successfully:

- PHP 5.2 or newer
- MySQL 5.0 or newer

It has not tested on IIS, but in theory should work just fine. Other DBs are
available... if you want to put in the time. ;)

If you run into a requirement that you don't see listed here, please let
the developers know!

Installing
--------

To install Florrie, you can clone it straight from the source! The following
command will work if you have shell access to your host:

git clone git:// (TODO - get URL!)

After you have a copy of the source code, make sure your web server can write to
the following directories:

- config
- strips

From there, you should be able to continue with the install process by simply
visiting your web site in your browser.
