Installing
--------

To install Florrie, you can clone it straight from the source! The following
command will work if you have shell access to your host:

git clone git:// (TODO - get URL!)

After you have a copy of the source code, make sure your web server can write to
the following directories:

- config
- strips

From there, you should be able to continue with the install process by simply
visiting your web site in your browser.
