Overview
--------

The Florrie module acts as the controller for the entire comic management
system. It is the first module initialized, and calls any other required
modules and plugins.

If this module is called from any page, and the comic system hasn't been
installed (or is unable to find it's configuration somehow), then the user
will be directed to the installation page.

If the installation page isn't present, as will be the case after Florrie has
been installed once, then an error will be displayed.
